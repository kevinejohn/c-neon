# Install

git clone https://github.com/kevinejohn/c-neon.git
```

# Run

Install dependencies

```
npm install

In case you don't have docker installed yet, install Docker (Planaria itself doesn't require Docker, but this app does):

- [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Install Docker for Linux, etc.](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/#server)

Now we're ready. First start Planaria:

```
node planaria
```

After Planaria has successfully started, open another terminal and start Planarium:

```
node planarium
```

And that's it!
